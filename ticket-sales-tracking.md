Creating a ticket sales tracking spreadsheet in Google Sheets is straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Steps to Create the Spreadsheet:
Log in to Google Sheets:

Open your web browser and go to Google Sheets.
Log in with your Google account credentials.
Create a New Spreadsheet:

Click the + Blank button to create a new spreadsheet.
Set Up Column Headers:

In the first row, add the following headers (adjust as necessary):
Name: To capture the name of the ticket recipient.
Ticket Number(s): To record the unique ticket numbers assigned.
Payment Status: Indicate whether the person has paid (e.g., "Paid" or "Pending").
Amount Paid: If necessary, capture the exact amount paid.
Assigned By: Track which team member assigned the tickets.
Customize for Team Access:

Click File > Share, then set the sharing permissions:
Add the email addresses of your team members.
Choose Editor as their permission level to allow them to update the sheet.
Format the Columns:

Use Data Validation for the Payment Status column:
Select the cells under "Payment Status."
Click Data > Data Validation.
Set criteria to "List of items" and enter: Paid, Pending.
For better readability, use conditional formatting:
Highlight rows where "Payment Status" is "Paid" in green.
Highlight rows where "Payment Status" is "Pending" in red.
Add Filters:

Highlight the header row and click Data > Create a Filter.
This allows team members to sort or filter the data by name, payment status, or ticket number.
Enable Real-Time Collaboration:

Ensure all team members are added to the shared list and have editing permissions.
Encourage them to update the spreadsheet immediately when tickets are assigned or payments are made.
Backup and Link Sharing:

Click File > Make a Copy periodically to back up your data.
Copy the link and share it with your team for easy access.
This setup will allow your team to track ticket assignments and payments efficiently while ensuring the data is always accessible and up to date.
